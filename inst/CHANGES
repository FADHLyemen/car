Changes to Version 1.0-0

   o Added functions for effects plots [see help(effect)].
   
   o Edited .Rd files to use \method{} for generics.
   
   o Changed some F's to f's
   
   o Modified durbin.watson to allow directional alternative hypotheses
   
Changes to Version 1.0-1

   o Reworked glm methods for Anova for type II LR and F tests to avoid scoping issues produced by use of update.
   
   o Added reset.par argument to scatterplot.default to allow addition of graphical elements to the plot.
   
   o The generic function Var and its methods are deprecated, in favour of vcov, now in the base package.
   
Changes to Version 1.0-2

    o The fitted line can be suppressed in qq.plot.
    
    o ceres.plots can now handle models that include transformed predictors -- e.g., log(x), I(x^2).
    
    o Fixed bug in Anova which caused it to fail calculating type-II F or LR tests for glms in certain circumstances. (Bug introduced in version 1.0-1.)

    o Made arguments of method functions consistent with generics (mostly adding ... to methods).
    
    o Fixed a bug in plot.effect which caused nonalphabetical orderings of factor levels to be lost; added arguments cex, xlim, and ylim to plot.effect.
    
    o Modified effect to permit computing effects for terms not in the model or with higher-order relatives in the model.
    
    o Added functions contr.Treatment, contr.Sum, and contr.Helmert; see help(Contrasts).
    
    o Added Burt.txt data set (to go with Burt.Rd documentation file already there).
    
    o Added Arrests.txt data set.
    
    o Fixed an error in hccm.lm which produced incorrect values for the "hc1", "hc2", and "hc3" corrections; added "hc4" correction.
    
    o Modified influence.glm to handle 0 prior weights; changes to influence.lm and influence.glm to insure compatibility with R 1.7.0.
    
    o removed quietly=TRUE from several calls to require(), to avoid invisibly altering the search path.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-3

    o All deletion diagnostics (with the exception of cookd) have been moved to the base package (as of R 1.7.0) and are removed from car; cookd now simply calls cooks.distance in the base package.
    
    o plot.effect modified was modified so that it can plot on the scale of the "link" function but label axes on the scale of the response. See ?plot.effect for details.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-4

    o Modified box.cox.powers to accept hypotheses to be tested.
    
    o Removed effect-display functions (to effects package).
    
    o Added warnings to Anova methods for F-tests in binomial and Poisson GLMs that the dispersion is estimated rather than taken as 1.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-5

    o Small changes to scatterplot and scatterplot.matrix to avoid "condition has length > 1" warnings.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-6

    o Print method for outlier.test no longer prints NA for Bonferroni p-values > 1; prints "> 1".
    
Changes to Version 1.0-7

    o More small changes to scatterplot to avoid "condition has length > 1" warnings.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-8

    o Small correction to documentation for recode.
    
    o Restored missing States data frame.
    
    o Small documentation changes to pass new package checks.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-9

    o vif now reports an error if the model has fewer than 2 terms (not counting the constant)
    
    o Small changes.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-10

    o scatterplot.formula made compatible with na.action=na.exclude.
    
    o Documentation corrections to satisfy package checks in R 1.9.0 (devel).
    
Changes to Version 1.0-11

    o More documentation fixes.
    
    o Fix to print method for outlier.test.
