Changes to Version 1.0-0

   o Added functions for effects plots [see help(effect)].
   
   o Edited .Rd files to use \method{} for generics.
   
   o Changed some F's to f's
   
   o Modified durbin.watson to allow directional alternative hypotheses
   
Changes to Version 1.0-1

   o Reworked glm methods for Anova for type II LR and F tests to avoid scoping issues produced by use of update.
   
   o Added reset.par argument to scatterplot.default to allow addition of graphical elements to the plot.
   
   o The generic function Var and its methods are deprecated, in favour of vcov, now in the base package.
   
Changes to Version 1.0-2

    o The fitted line can be suppressed in qq.plot.
    
    o ceres.plots can now handle models that include transformed predictors -- e.g., log(x), I(x^2).
    
    o Fixed bug in Anova which caused it to fail calculating type-II F or LR tests for glms in certain circumstances. (Bug introduced in version 1.0-1.)

    o Made arguments of method functions consistent with generics (mostly adding ... to methods).
    
    o Fixed a bug in plot.effect which caused nonalphabetical orderings of factor levels to be lost; added arguments cex, xlim, and ylim to plot.effect.
    
    o Modified effect to permit computing effects for terms not in the model or with higher-order relatives in the model.
    
    o Added functions contr.Treatment, contr.Sum, and contr.Helmert; see help(Contrasts).
    
    o Added Burt.txt data set (to go with Burt.Rd documentation file already there).
    
    o Added Arrests.txt data set.
    
    o Fixed an error in hccm.lm which produced incorrect values for the "hc1", "hc2", and "hc3" corrections; added "hc4" correction.
    
    o Modified influence.glm to handle 0 prior weights; changes to influence.lm and influence.glm to insure compatibility with R 1.7.0.
    
    o removed quietly=TRUE from several calls to require(), to avoid invisibly altering the search path.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-3

    o All deletion diagnostics (with the exception of cookd) have been moved to the base package (as of R 1.7.0) and are removed from car; cookd now simply calls cooks.distance in the base package.
    
    o plot.effect modified was modified so that it can plot on the scale of the "link" function but label axes on the scale of the response. See ?plot.effect for details.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-4

    o Modified box.cox.powers to accept hypotheses to be tested.
    
    o Removed effect-display functions (to effects package).
    
    o Added warnings to Anova methods for F-tests in binomial and Poisson GLMs that the dispersion is estimated rather than taken as 1.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-5

    o Small changes to scatterplot and scatterplot.matrix to avoid "condition has length > 1" warnings.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-6

    o Print method for outlier.test no longer prints NA for Bonferroni p-values > 1; prints "> 1".
    
Changes to Version 1.0-7

    o More small changes to scatterplot to avoid "condition has length > 1" warnings.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-8

    o Small correction to documentation for recode.
    
    o Restored missing States data frame.
    
    o Small documentation changes to pass new package checks.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-9

    o vif now reports an error if the model has fewer than 2 terms (not counting the constant)
    
    o Small changes.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-10

    o scatterplot.formula made compatible with na.action=na.exclude.
    
    o Documentation corrections to satisfy package checks in R 1.9.0 (devel).
    
Changes to Version 1.0-11

    o More documentation fixes.
    
    o Fix to print method for outlier.test.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-12

    o Small fix to box.cox.powers to avoid inconsequential warnings.
    
    o Removed dependency on now nonexistent modreg package.
    
    o Moved levene.test and influence.plot functions to car from the Rcmdr package.
    
    o box.cox now reports an error when it cannot compute an automatic start.
    
    o Fixed bug in ceres.plot.lm that caused an error when the subset argument was used to exclude observations in fitting the model.
    
    o Changed ncv.test to allow weighted lm object (suggested by Sandy Weisberg).
    
    o scatterplot.matrix now passes ... argument to pairs (also suggested by Sandy Weisberg).
    
Changes to Version 1.0-13

    o Small changes to levene.test and box.cox.powers to make output compatible with version 0.9-10 of the Rcmdr package.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-14

    o cr.plots() ignored its span argument when variable was specified in the call (thanks to Christophe Pallier for pointing this out).
    
    o Added some(), which prints a few randomly selected elements (or rows) of an object.
    
    o Added Anova() methods for multinomial logistic regression [via multinom() in the nnet package], and for proportional-odds logistic regression [via polr() in the MASS package). 
    
    o Made influence.plot() generic, with a method for lm objects that handles glm objects as well. 
    
Changes to Version 1.0-15

    o Changed recode() to accommodate factor levels with spaces (suggested by Dan Putler).
    
    o Added cex* arguments to scatterplot() and scatterplot.matrix(), and a jitter argument to scatterplot (suggested by CG Pettersson).
    
    o Added symbox() function for selecting a transformation to symmetry (a modified version of a function contributed by Gregor Gorjanc).
    
    o ncv.test() modified so that it doesn't fail when the variance formula has a different pattern of NAs than the model formula (adapting a suggestion by Achim Zeileis).
    
    o Added argument to spread.level.plot.default() to optionally suppress point labels (suggested by Josyf Mychaleckyj). 
    
    o vif() modified by Henric Nilsson to be applicable to generalized linear models and other models inheriting from class lm. Weighted linear models are now allowed. 
    
Changes to Version 1.0-16

    o Modified to linear.hypothesis by Achim Zeleis to support alternative coefficient covariance-matrix estimators for linear models (via new vcov argument); to provide both chisquare and F tests for both linear and generalized-linear models (via new test argument); and to produce neater output (from both .lm and .glm methods).
    
    o Anova methods modified to work with new linear.hypothesis functions.
    
Changes to Version 1.0-17

    o Fixed a bug in scatterplot() that caused marginal boxplots to be incorrect when xlim or ylim arguments are supplied (pointed out by Erich Neuwirth).
    
Changes to Version 1.0-18

    o Restored print.chisq.test(), used by ncv.test() (which had been removed when linear.hypothesis was changed).
    
    o Fixed bug in recode(), which caused error when all of the recode targets for a numeric variable contain a numeral but can't be coerced to numeric (reported by David Dailey).
